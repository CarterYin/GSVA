## Introduction

### Motivation

<img align="left" src="figures/introduction.png" width=400px>

Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) has recently been proposed to support multiple-target and empty-target cases, which are practical in real world application but omitted in classic RES tasks. GRES poses the challenges that require the model to **handle complex spatial relationships of the instances** in the image to *segment the targets at various locations* and *reject the empty targets in the wrong places*. Current segmentation MLLM focuses more on the complex referring expressions which could benefit from the LLM, however the multiple-target and empty-target challenges remain uncharted.

In this paper, we propose **Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA)** to address this gap. Specifically, GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the null targets explicitly.

### Method

![Method](figures/method.png)

The architecture of GSVA follows current segmentation MLLMs like LISA, which enables high-fidelity segmentation outputs by integrating two types of foundation models: (1) Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an aligned vision-language cognitive module; (2) Segmentation Foundation Model (SFM) to segment the target out of the input image based on user’s instruction. A special token [SEG] is used to prompt the SFM to follow the user instruction for desired referring segmentation outputs.

**GSVA** relax the one-to-one constraint to support multiple target outputs via learning multiple [SEG] tokens. By prompting each [SEG] token with the corresponding target expression, GSVA segments different mask for each target. For absent targets, GSVA predicts a [REJ] token to mark a rejection in the output sequence, therefore the empty target expressions are appropriately rejected.

### Pre-trained weights

#### LLaVA-vicuna-v1.1 and LLaVA-Llama2

We follow LISA with 3 variants of [LLaVA], for LLaVA-vicuna-v1.1, we apply the delta weights `liuhaotian/LLaVA-Lightning-7B-delta-v1-1` and `liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v1-1` to llama-7b and llama-13b base weights, respectively. For LLaVA-Llama-2, we use the full weights of `liuhaotian/llava-llama-2-13b-chat-lightning-preview`. For LLaVA pretrained models, please see the instructions in [LLaVA model zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#legacy-models-delta-weights).


#### SAM

The pretrained weights of SAM can be found in [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything?tab=readme-ov-file#model-checkpoints).


## Evaluation on Trained Models

### Download Model Weights

The pretrained models can be found in [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!ApI0vb6wPqmtku1kOKbVTJkwa6jG_Q?e=vaG9Gj) and [TsinghuaCloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/1423fb16fdb9445e8155/).

### Evaluation

Modify the templates in `scripts/eval_demo.sh` with appropriate paths, then execute

```
bash scripts/eval_demo.sh
```

For example, set the `weight` argument in `scripts/eval_demo.sh` to `gsva-7b-pt.bin`, and `gsva-7b-ft-gres.bin`, then set the `val_dataset` to `grefcoco|unc|val`, `grefcoco|unc|testA`, and `grefcoco|unc|testB`, the evaluation scritps will give the following results:

which corresponds to the **Line 8 and Line 10 in Table 1** of the paper. Note that the numbers may vary w.r.t. the precision during inference and appear slightly differrent from them in the paper.

## Training a New Model

Modify the templates in `scripts/train_demo.sh` with appropriate paths, then execute

```
bash scripts/train_demo.sh
```

After the training process is done, use this file in the experiment working directory:
```
zero_to_fp32.py
```
to convert the ZeRO weight shards to a bin file to store the trained model weights. For training hyper-parameters, please refer to **Appendix A** of the paper.

If you want to start from a pretrained GSVA model for further finetuning, please consider set the `weight` argument to `<path-to-your-model>.bin`.
